Gaussian blur is the fastest of the three options and is usually good for most applications.

Median filtering is a non-parametric operation which is really useful when you want to get rid of things like speckle noise.

Neither gaussian nor median filters preserve edges, meaning after applying the filter the location of edges in your image will move. A bilateral filter is edge preserving, but it is slower than a Gaussian filter.
